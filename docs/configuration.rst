=========================
Application configuration
=========================

Pytheon can deploy any python application with only a few modification.

Add a ``deploy.ini`` file with a deploy section like this:

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [deploy]


Django based application
========================

You need to point your settings.py in the deploy.ini file:

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [deploy]
    settings = myapp/settings.py


Handling static files
=====================

You can add some static directories. Those one will be aliased in the web server:

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [deploy]
    static =
        /statics/ = myapp/statics/


*host* option
=============

When you deploy you application with ``pytheon-admin`` or ``buildout install deploy`` you can set the *hostname*
of you web application like this :

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ pytheon-admin -d git://example.com/myapp.git --host=mydomain.com

or with buildout :

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ buildout install deploy deploy:host=mydomain.com

You can also define *hostname* in your ``deploy.ini`` or ``buildout.cfg`` files.

In ``deploy.ini`` file :

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [deploy]
    â€¦
    host=mydomain.com

or in ``buildout.cfg`` file :

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [deploy]
    eggs = pyramid
    host=mydomain.com


*deploy-dir* option
===================


pip based application
=====================

If your project contain a ``requirements.txt`` then pytheon will use it to fetch dependencies.


Buildout based applications
===========================

You can also use your ``buildout.cfg`` instead of a deploy.ini (or use both)

You can add deps as usual:

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [deploy]
    eggs = pyramid

.. Note:: You can use this sample application : https://github.com/pytheon/sample_buildout
